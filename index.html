    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Stitching Hope began with a mix of frustration, compassion, and inspiration. While working as a medical assistant in geriatrics, Khushi often heard residents express their sadness and isolation. They felt a lack of community and purpose, as if their hobbies were just ways to pass the time. Simultaneously, living in Philadelphia where there seemed to be a homeless person on every other street corner, she felt powerless walking past the unhoused community each day. She saw people struggle without even basic necessities such as socks and gloves in the frigid cold, wishing she could do more. The idea for the nonprofit began to take shape one holiday break while Khushi was helping her younger brother, Krish, clean out his room. Among the old clothes and toys they planned to donate, they stumbled upon piles of Krish’s crochet projects: years worth of hats, scarves, and trinkets that had been accumulating since the fourth grade. There are only so many one family can use, but what felt like a surplus to them, they realized in that moment, could be life-changing for someone in need. Donating his projects sparked the thought that perhaps many others may have the same “problem,” which could actually become a solution for those in need. Remembering the senior citizens who also loved to knit and crochet, the vision formed. From this vision, Stitching Hope was born: a bridge between communities. By giving seniors a renewed sense of meaning through making, while directly addressing the needs of the unhoused, Stitching Hope creates connection, purpose, and impact with every stitch.</p>
